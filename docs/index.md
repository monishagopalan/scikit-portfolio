# Welcome to scikit-portfolio

Scikit-portfolio is a Python package designed to introduce **data scientists and machine learning engineers** to the 
problem of **optimal portfolio allocation in finance**.
The main idea of scikit-portfolio is to provide many well-known portfolio optimization methods with an easily
accessible **scikit-learn inspired** set of API. 

This approach makes it possible to incorporate portfolio estimators **as if they are classical scikit-learn 
estimators**, thus enabling cross-validation and hyperparameters optimization with the tools of the Python data-science toolkit, and with an eye the highly technical domain of investment portfolio management.

This library is based upon the following open-source tools:

- [PyPortfolioOpt](https://pyportfolioopt.readthedocs.io/): a library for portfolio optimization and risk management.
- [cvxpy](https://cvxpy.org): a tool for convex optimization that makes it very easy to write optimization problem, with complex objective functions and constraints.
- [numpy](https://numpy.org): numerical analysis and linear algebra in Python.
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org): manipulation of structured data tables in Python.
 
## Getting started
If you already have some background of portfolio optimization, and just want to jump start into the usage of the 
library, [read hereüíªÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è](getting_started).

Otherwise if you are relatively new to financial portfolio optimization, [read this introduction üë®‚ÄçüéìÔ∏è](portfolio_optimization_theory.md), where we provide the reader a coincise overview over the main ideas and methods in portfolio optimization.
